### Prerequisites:
  - Git should be installed in the system
  - If not take a look here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - Terminal :P

### To get started

- Fork the repo: https://github.com/govindgoel/git-basics/fork  
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/git-basics.git`
- Navigate to the cloned repo: `cd git-basics`
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b {yourName}`
- Now you can add a new file with name `yourName-exploring-git.md` and write something in it.
- It's time to push your changes:
  - First see what you have added/changed by doing: `git status`
  - To add changes to staging do: `git add .` 
  - To commit changes do: `git commit -m "yourName-learning-git"` [in quotes you provide the commit message basically]
  - To push changes do: `git push origin {branchName}` [it will be your name that you used to create a branch]
  - If it asks to add upstream then do that and push again otherwise it's done.
  
- To create a pull request:
  - Go to the repo in your Github account and click on contribute<span>
